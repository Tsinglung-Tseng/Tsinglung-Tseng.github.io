### Managing Harbor's lifecycle
You can use docker-compose to manage the lifecycle of Harbor. Some useful commands are listed as follows (must run in the same directory as docker-compose.yml).

```bash
#Stopping Harbor:

$ sudo docker-compose stop
Stopping nginx ... done
Stopping harbor-jobservice ... done
Stopping harbor-ui ... done
Stopping harbor-db ... done
Stopping registry ... done
Stopping harbor-log ... done
Restarting Harbor after stopping:

$ sudo docker-compose start
Starting log ... done
Starting ui ... done
Starting mysql ... done
Starting jobservice ... done
Starting registry ... done
Starting proxy ... done

# To change Harbor's configuration, first stop existing Harbor instance and update 
# harbor.cfg. Then run prepare script to populate the configuration. Finally re-create and 
# start Harbor's instance:

$ sudo docker-compose down -v
$ vim harbor.cfg
$ sudo prepare
$ sudo docker-compose up -d
```
