## [Engine](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_2/core/connections.html?highlight=connection#sqlalchemy.engine.Connection.connection)

* The typical usage of create_engine() is once per particular database URL, held globally for the **lifetime of a single application process**.
* 一个 Engine 管理多个 DBAPI connection, intended to be called upon in a concurrent fashion (并发方式)
* 对于多线程应用，需要每个线程都有一个 Engine

## Connection

A proxy object for an actual DBAPI connection. 

```python
connection = engine.connect()
result = connection.execute("select username from users")
for row in result:
    print("username:", row['username'])
connection.close()
```

* 返回值是一个 **ResultProxy** 
* ResultProxy 提供了与DBAPI cursor 兼容的接口
* The DBAPI cursor will be closed by the ResultProxy when all of its result rows (if any) are exhausted

## Transaction

The **Connection** object provides a **begin()** method which returns a **Transaction** object.
