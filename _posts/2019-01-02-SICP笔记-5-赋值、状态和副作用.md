An assignment is the first ting we have that produces the difference between a before and an after.

```
<before>
(SET! <var> <value>)
<after>
```

纯函数的运行结果无关上下文，无关运行次数。但是一旦引入 assignment 一切都会不同。

## —— 代换模型的失效

```lisp
(define count 1)

(define (demo x)
    (set! count (1+ count))
    (+ x count))

==> (demo 3)
5

==> (demo 3)
6
```

```lisp
(define (fact n)
    (define (iter m i)
        (cond ((> i n) m)
            (else (iter (* i m) (+ i 1)))))
    (iter 1 1))                      A
                                     |
                                     |
                The only way to putting a time on the process


(define (fact n)
    (let ((i 1) (m 1))
        (define (loop)
            (cond (> i n) m)
            (else
                (set! m (* i m))
                (set! i (+ i 1))
                (loop))))
        (loop))
```

代换模型就是你复制过程的体，并用实际参数代换形式参数。

### Environment model

**Bound Variables** (约束变量)

We say that a variable, y, is "bound in an expression", E. If the meaning of E is unchanged by the uniform replecement of a variable, W, not occurring in E, for every occurrence of y to E.

∀x ∃y P(x,y) -- x, y 是 bounded

(ƛ (y) ((ƛ (x) (* x y)) 3)) -- 两个 ƛ 分别 bound 到了 x, y

(ƛ(x) (* x y)) -- y 是自由变量

If x is a bound variable in E, then there is a lambda expression where it is bound. We call the list of formal parameters of the lambda expression the "bound variable list" and we say that the lambda expression "binds" the variables "declared" in its bound variable list. In addition, these parts of the expression where a variable has value defined by the labmda expression which binds it is called the "scope" of the variable.

An environment is a way of doing substitutions virtually. 它是储存你的未完成的代换的地方。It is a place where everything accumulates, where the names of the variables are associated with the values they have, such that, when you way what the name mean, you look up a environment.

环境是一个 structured table, 它由frame组成，frame chained together.

Rule1: 如何apply procedure 到 argument. Constructing a nre frame, bingindg the formal parameters of the procedure to the actrual argumets of the call,
and, then evaluating the body of the procedure in the context of the new environment constructed. The new frame has as its enclosing environment the environment part of the procedure object being applied.

Rule2: A ƛ is evaluated relative to a giben environment as follows: a new procedure obvject is formed, combining the text (code) of the ƛ with a pointer to the environment of evaluation.

```lisp
(ƛ (y)      ((ƛ (x) (* x y)) 3))
    |        ---------------
    |               |    |____> ƛ bound to the whole thing, y is free
    |               |
    v               v
 y是自由变量,    在一个y已经被定义的环境中执行     
```

**define 是改变环境的一种方式**

### Actions & Identity

We say that an action A. had an effect on an object X. if some property P. which was true of X before A became false of X after A.

We say that two objects X and Y are the same if any action which has an effect on X has the same effect on Y.
